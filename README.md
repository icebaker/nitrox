## Open Source and Transparency

Nitrox is an open-source Lightning Node Management Application with an [MIT license](https://github.com/icebaker/nitrox/blob/main/LICENSE), which means that anyone can use, modify, and build upon the project for any purpose.

The main version of Nitrox may include optional paid features or services, such as submarine swaps, liquidity provision, and routing optimization, a common practice in node management applications. Services from the project owner may be prioritized in the interface, always with transparency to users. Multiple providers can coexist, allowing users the freedom to choose their preferred provider.

When contributing to the project, please be aware of the owner's control over service offerings. Your contributions are important to the project's growth and success. We appreciate your involvement in helping shape the future of Nitrox and enhancing the Lightning Network experience for everyone within the open-source community.
